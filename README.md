## 🎮 What is Zip Game?

**Zip Game** is an innovative puzzle game that challenges players to connect numbered dots (1-8) while filling every single cell in a grid using one continuous path. It's a perfect blend of classic connect-the-dots and strategic path planning that provides an excellent brain workout for players of all ages.

### 🎯 Game Objective
- **Connect dots 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8** in numerical sequence
- **Fill every cell** in the grid with your path
- **Use only L-shaped moves** (horizontal then vertical, or vice versa)
- **Complete the puzzle** when you reach dot 8 after visiting all cells

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Basic Rules
1. **Start at Dot 1**: Click and drag from the numbered dot "1"
2. **Sequential Connection**: Connect dots in order (1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8)
3. **Fill Every Cell**: Your path must visit every single cell in the grid
4. **L-Shaped Moves**: Move horizontally first, then vertically (or vice versa)
5. **Victory Condition**: Reach dot 8 after filling all cells

### Game Controls
- **Desktop**: Click and drag with mouse
- **Mobile**: Touch and drag with finger
- **Undo**: Clear your current path and start over
- **New Game**: Generate a fresh puzzle
- **Show Solution**: Reveal the solution when stuck

### Difficulty Levels

## 🎓 Strategy Tips

### Beginner Tips
1. **Study the grid** before making your first move
2. **Plan backwards** from dot 8 to understand the end goal
3. **Use corners wisely** - they have limited access points
4. **Count cells** to ensure you'll visit them all
5. **Practice with 5×5** before attempting 6×6 grids

### Advanced Strategies
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn common path patterns
2. **Corner Strategy**: Always consider corner cell accessibility
3. **Bottleneck Identification**: Spot narrow passages early
4. **Segment Planning**: Break the puzzle into logical sections
5. **Error Recovery**: Use undo strategically to explore options
